          <h2>Disturbing Correlations for States With Lower Median Income and Their At-Risk Residents</h2>
          <p>The data plots shown above are from the 2014 US Census 1-year estimates.  In the first scatter plot there is 
            an apparent trend as states with higher a proportion of poverty tend to have larger % of those state’s citizens 
            not have healthcare.  Since healthcare is a large expense and access to it can be challenging.  Also, it 
            should be noted that states (such as Louisiana, Mississippi, and Georgia ) with larger rural populations also tend 
            to lack healthcare and have higher poverty rates.</p>

          <p>When looking the states’ median ages and the rate of smoking percentage, it is expected that those states in the 
            upper right of the scatter plot will be the highest risks of current and future health issues.  These states such 
            as West Virginia should expect to see shorter life spans and increasing healthcare costs.   </p>

          <p>It is interesting to note when comparing states median household income to obesity, states with higher income tend 
            to have lower obesity rates.  It can be inferred that residents in states of lower income will consume lower cost, 
            but unhealthy meals such as fast food.  For states like West Virginia and Mississippi they will have higher risk of 
            health issues and an increased challenge to pay for it.  </p>
